# Interactive-Memory-game-jsWelcome to the GitHub page for my interactive JavaScript game!

I am thrilled to share with you a project that I have been working on, which combines my passion for programming and gaming. This game is designed to challenge your skills and test your reflexes, providing hours of fun and entertainment.

In this game, you will navigate through different levels, each with its unique set of obstacles and challenges. You will have to use your strategic thinking and quick reflexes to overcome each level and progress through the game.

This project has been a great opportunity for me to hone my programming skills and explore the potential of JavaScript as a game development platform. I am excited to share this game with the world and invite you to try it out and give me your feedback.
